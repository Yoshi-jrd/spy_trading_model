## Current State and Immediate Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps: Core Prediction Validation

#### 1. **Model Prediction Accuracy Validation**

- **Objective**: Validate model’s ability to predict SPY price within a 12-96 hour window.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** and **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** to evaluate prediction accuracy.
  - **Confidence Interval**: Confirm that the model’s predicted range (e.g., 75% confidence interval) accurately encompasses actual SPY prices within this timeframe.
- **Modules to Evaluate/Run**:
  - **`train_models.py`**: Run with best parameters post-hypertuning to generate predictions for test data.
  - **`evaluate_model.py`**: Assess model accuracy and error metrics on 12-96 hour predictions.
- **Visualization**:
  - Use `plot_spy_data.py` to visualize actual vs. predicted prices, including confidence intervals, to inspect prediction quality.

#### 2. **Set Tolerance Thresholds for Accuracy**

- **Define acceptable error ranges** (e.g., within ±2% of the actual price) for live trading viability.
- **Iterate** if needed, adjusting model parameters or feature engineering based on results.

#### 3. **Comprehensive Backtesting Preparation**

- **Focus**: Proceed with trade simulation logic only if the model’s predictions meet the defined tolerable error range for the 12-96 hour window.
- **Modules to Prepare**:
  - **`backtest_strategy.py`**: Finalize for strategy testing based on validated predictions.
  - **`simulate_trade.py`**: To be developed for testing trade executions based on refined predictions.

This roadmap and directory structure outline a structured development plan for achieving a predictive SPY trading model with efficient data handling, backtesting, real-time monitoring, and potential for future enhancements.

Summary of Actionable Next Steps:

    Integrate stacking into this mini-script with weight optimization.
    Test with longer forward prediction windows (e.g., 24-hour, 36-hour).
    Conduct hyperparameter tuning and feature selection for RandomForest.
    Add confidence intervals around predictions.
    Validate with LSTM to observe if sequential modeling improves results.

Proposed Enhancements

To build on the working code, I recommend three main actions:

    Add Longer Prediction Horizons Over a 30-Day Period:
        Create a rolling prediction framework to simulate forward-looking predictions as if we’re forecasting daily for a month.
        This will use intervals of 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h, and 168h, providing insights into how the model performs in an extended simulation.

    Incorporate More Model Layers for Stacking:
        Consider adding additional layers, such as LSTM or ensemble techniques like AdaBoost, especially for capturing longer-term dependencies (e.g., 96h, 168h).
        Ensure compatibility with stacking by defining how these layers interact with the current ensemble and optimize weight allocations.

    Analyze and Fine-Tune Model Hyperparameters:
        Conduct hyperparameter tuning for individual models (particularly the RandomForest and GradientBoosting models, as they often contribute heavily).
        Set up a grid search or use an optimizer to find the best parameters based on each timeframe and horizon, aiming to reduce MAE and RMSE further.

Implementation Plan

    Set Up Rolling Predictions:
        Modify the mini_train_models function to create rolling predictions over 30 days.
        Use a loop to simulate daily predictions for each target horizon and track cumulative results.

    Integrate New Models:
        Add LSTM and other layers (if feasible with your current hardware setup) to the model stacking function.
        Test how these new models contribute to different timeframes, and use optimize_weights to determine their optimal inclusion.

    Hyperparameter Tuning:
        Implement a tuning process, either within the existing script or as a standalone function, to test different settings for n_estimators, max_depth, and learning_rate.
        Focus tuning efforts on the most impactful models and horizons (e.g., 5m-24h and 1h-12h).

Implementation Plan

    Implement Interval-Specific Models with a Meta-Model:
        Train individual models for each timeframe (24h, 48h, 72h, etc.) and stack their predictions through a lightweight meta-model to determine optimal weights.

    Incorporate LSTM/GRU for Longer Horizons:
        Add LSTM to the model ensemble, specifically targeting the 48h+ predictions where sequential dependency is most critical.

    Enhance Feature Engineering:
        Add lagged features, seasonal patterns, and introduce new indicators.

Starting with this approach should yield noticeable improvements, particularly in reducing errors for 48h, 72h, and 96h horizons, which are typically more challenging. Let me know if you'd like detailed guidance on implementing each step or to start with a specific one.
