## Immediate Next Steps: Core Prediction Validation

### 1. **Model Prediction Accuracy Validation**

- **Objective**: Assess the model’s ability to predict SPY price within a 12-96 hour window.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** and **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** to evaluate prediction accuracy.
  - **Confidence Interval**: Confirm that the model’s predicted range (e.g., 75% confidence interval) accurately encompasses actual SPY prices within this timeframe.
- **Modules to Evaluate/Run**:
  - **`train_models.py`** (Post-hypertuning): Run with best parameters to generate predictions for test data.
  - **`evaluate_model.py`**: Validate accuracy and review error metrics on 12-96 hour predictions.
- **Visualization**:
  - Use `plot_spy_data.py` to visualize actual vs. predicted prices, including confidence intervals, to visually inspect prediction quality.

## Implementation Focus

      For the first backtest, the focus will be on validating that the model can reliably predict price movements in the specified timeframe (12-96 hours) and generate accurate buy/sell signals. By starting with basic validation and signal testing, we can confirm that the model is sufficiently accurate for more complex trading strategies, ultimately building toward a robust, automated trade execution system.

      Once this initial backtest module proves successful, we can progressively add more sophisticated logic, such as dynamic trade management, rolling, stop-loss adjustments, and enhanced entry/exit conditions based on confidence intervals or economic indicators.

### 2. **Set Tolerance Thresholds for Accuracy**

- **Define acceptable error ranges** (e.g., within ±2% of the actual price) for the predictions to be considered viable for live trading.
- **Iterate** if needed, adjusting model parameters or feature engineering based on results.

### 3. **Comprehensive Backtesting Preparation**

- **Focus**: Only proceed with trade simulation logic if the model’s predictions fall within the defined tolerable error range for the 12-96 hour window.
- **Modules to Prepare**:
  - **`backtest_strategy.py`**: Only finalize this module once prediction accuracy is validated. The strategy can then focus on entry and exit logic, based on validated predictions.
  - **`simulate_trade.py`**: To be developed later; use it to test trade executions based on refined predictions.

---

### Summary

Our priority is to validate and ensure prediction accuracy within the target range (12-96 hours) before implementing trade logic. By establishing a baseline accuracy, we increase the reliability of any future trade simulations and live trading strategies. This approach prevents the risk of implementing complex trading logic on a model that may not yet be accurate enough for real-world application.

---

This validation-first strategy will help us create a solid foundation for the predictive aspect of our SPY options trading model, paving the way for reliable backtesting and trade simulations.

### 6. **Workflow and Evaluation Coordination**

- **Evaluate/Update**:
  - `run_evaluation_workflow.py`: Ensure it coordinates all evaluation steps (model predictions, backtesting, trade simulations) in a single workflow for streamlined testing.

## Integration and Module Relationships

### Data Flow

- **`data_loader.py`** pulls raw data, **`indicator_calculator.py`** processes indicators, and **`data_storage.py`** saves the cleaned data for use by models.
- **`train_models.py`** uses **`data_loader.py`** outputs and best parameters from **`best_params.pkl`** to train models.
- **`hypertune_models.py`** optimizes hyperparameters, updating **`best_params.pkl`** for use in **`train_models.py`**.

### Model Training and Evaluation

- **`train_models.py`** trains models across timeframes and stores results in **`saved_models/`**.
- **`evaluate_model.py`** and **`run_evaluation_workflow.py`** assess model accuracy, while **`simulate_trade.py`** tests trading strategies.

### Real-Time Execution Preparation

- **`generate_trade_signals.py`** will create trade signals in real-time once the model is ready for live execution.
- **`live_trade_executor.py`** (to be developed) will automate trade placement based on model predictions and signals.

### Backtesting and Future Improvements

- **`backtest_strategy.py`** runs historical tests to validate model decisions.
- Future considerations include incorporating reinforcement learning in **`rl_model.py`** and refining visualizations in **`plot_spy_data.py`**.

This roadmap and directory structure outline a structured development plan for achieving a predictive SPY trading model with efficient data handling, backtesting, real-time monitoring, and potential for future enhancements.
