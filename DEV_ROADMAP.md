## Current State and Immediate Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps: Core Prediction Validation

#### 1. **Model Prediction Accuracy Validation**

- **Objective**: Validate model’s ability to predict SPY price within a 12-96 hour window.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** and **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** to evaluate prediction accuracy.
  - **Confidence Interval**: Confirm that the model’s predicted range (e.g., 75% confidence interval) accurately encompasses actual SPY prices within this timeframe.
- **Modules to Evaluate/Run**:
  - **`train_models.py`**: Run with best parameters post-hypertuning to generate predictions for test data.
  - **`evaluate_model.py`**: Assess model accuracy and error metrics on 12-96 hour predictions.
- **Visualization**:
  - Use `plot_spy_data.py` to visualize actual vs. predicted prices, including confidence intervals, to inspect prediction quality.

#### 2. **Set Tolerance Thresholds for Accuracy**

- **Define acceptable error ranges** (e.g., within ±2% of the actual price) for live trading viability.
- **Iterate** if needed, adjusting model parameters or feature engineering based on results.

#### 3. **Comprehensive Backtesting Preparation**

- **Focus**: Proceed with trade simulation logic only if the model’s predictions meet the defined tolerable error range for the 12-96 hour window.
- **Modules to Prepare**:
  - **`backtest_strategy.py`**: Finalize for strategy testing based on validated predictions.
  - **`simulate_trade.py`**: To be developed for testing trade executions based on refined predictions.

# SPY Trading Model Development Roadmap

## Current State

- **Model Overview:** The model currently uses a combination of LSTM, RandomForest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting models stacked together with a Ridge meta-model for predicting SPY price movements. This setup shows moderate success in predicting short-term intervals (24h and 48h) but struggles with accuracy over longer intervals (72h and 96h).
- **Performance Summary:**
  - **24h Interval:** MAE: ~4.12, RMSE: ~5.33
  - **48h Interval:** MAE: ~3.20, RMSE: ~4.62
  - **72h Interval:** MAE: ~6.77, RMSE: ~7.57
  - **96h Interval:** MAE: ~10.29, RMSE: ~10.85
- **Model Challenges:**
  - Inconsistent accuracy for longer prediction intervals (72h and 96h).
  - Limited feature engineering and lack of dynamic weighting/regularization in the stacked model.
  - Limited dataset and synthetic data for robust training.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Feature Engineering Enhancements:**

   - Add advanced technical indicators such as ADX, VWAP, and Chaikin Oscillator.
   - Create rolling window features (averages, volatility measures) for 1-hour and 1-day intervals.

2. **Dynamic Weight Optimization:**

   - Implement dynamic weight adjustments in the Ridge meta-model for different prediction intervals.
   - Add regularization techniques (L1, L2 penalties) to improve the generalization of the model.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**

   - Run a thorough grid/randomized search on key hyperparameters for the LSTM, RandomForest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting models.
   - Adjust epochs dynamically based on the prediction interval to prevent overfitting on short-term data.

4. **Hybrid Model Approach:**
   - Explore a hybrid approach by integrating ARIMA or GARCH models to better capture trends for longer-term (72h, 96h) predictions.

## Short-Term Goals (0-3 Months)

1. **Model Refinement:**

   - Test and validate new technical indicators and rolling window features to evaluate their impact on accuracy.
   - Complete implementation of dynamic weight adjustments and test the impact on 24h and 48h predictions.
   - Incorporate ARIMA or GARCH models for 72h and 96h intervals, analyzing potential improvements in accuracy.

2. **Data Augmentation and Expansion:**

   - Expand the historical dataset and explore synthetic data generation to increase data diversity for training.
   - Refine the `data_loader` to handle large datasets and new indicators effectively.

3. **Backtesting and Validation:**
   - Develop a robust backtesting module to evaluate model predictions on a rolling basis across all intervals.
   - Test the updated model on a sample of real-world historical SPY data to validate short- and medium-term accuracy.

## Long-Term Goals (3-12 Months)

1. **Enhanced Model Execution and Deployment:**

   - Finalize an efficient and robust model pipeline with minimal latency for real-time predictions.
   - Prepare for deployment on a production-grade system, leveraging GPU/parallel processing to maximize performance.

2. **Refinement of Execution Strategy:**

   - Integrate additional real-time data sources (news sentiment, earnings, etc.) and explore their impact on predictions.
   - Develop an ensemble confidence weighting system that adapts based on market volatility and historical accuracy per timeframe.

3. **Continuous Model Testing and Adaptation:**

   - Implement an automated framework for continuous model retraining and backtesting using new data.
   - Establish periodic model evaluation benchmarks and review model accuracy monthly to fine-tune weights, parameters, and features as needed.

4. **Advanced Strategy Development:**
   - Develop and refine a strategy for executing live trades based on model predictions, including risk management and portfolio allocation tactics.
   - Monitor model performance in live trading scenarios and iterate based on real-world outcomes to refine prediction confidence intervals and accuracy.

This roadmap will help ensure that the SPY trading model evolves effectively, meeting both short-term objectives for improved accuracy and long-term goals for robust, real-time trading applications.
