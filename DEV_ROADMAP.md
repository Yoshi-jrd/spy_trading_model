SPY Trading Model Development Roadmap
Project Overview

    Objective: Develop a predictive SPY options trading model focused on maximizing profitability in short-term options trades.
    Core Strategies: Credit spreads, debit spreads, condors, straddles, and other options strategies with informed trade entries and exits.
    Primary Technologies: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, XGBoost.
    Structure: Modular setup for efficiency and scalability, supporting real-time trade execution.

Current Model Performance and Challenges

    Model Structure: The model stacks LSTM, RandomForest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting predictions with a Ridge meta-model.
    Performance Summary (MAE/RMSE across intervals):
        24h: ~4.12 / ~5.33
        48h: ~3.20 / ~4.62
        72h: ~6.77 / ~7.57
        96h: ~10.29 / ~10.85
    Key Issues:
        Reduced accuracy over longer prediction intervals.
        Limited feature engineering and weighting customization.
        Insufficient data diversity for robust training.

Immediate Next Steps

    Generate a Year of 15-Minute Data
        Objective: Create a synthetic, continuous year of 15-minute interval data for more extensive model training.
        Steps:
            Combine available 15-minute, 1-hour, and 1-day interval data into a single year-long dataset.
            Implement and verify this in data_processing/data_augmentation.py.
            Confirm accuracy through plotting and visual inspection of data trends.
        Integration:
            Use this data for comprehensive model training to enhance predictive accuracy.

    Out-of-Sequence Testing
        Objective: Validate model performance with data held out from the training set, simulating real-time testing conditions.
        Steps:
            Use the 15-minute synthetic year data for initial training.
            Hold out recent intervals as unseen test data for model evaluation.
            Plot predictions against actual prices to assess generalization and accuracy.

    Core Prediction Accuracy Validation
        Objective: Validate predictive accuracy within 12-96 hour timeframes.
        Metrics: Confirm precision with MAE and RMSE; visualize confidence intervals.

    Feature Engineering Enhancements
        Objective: Focus on MACD Histogram, RSI, Bollinger Bands, SMA/EMA; add dynamic rolling windows for improved accuracy.
        Interval-Specific Weighting: Tailor Ridge meta-model with L1/L2 penalties for specific intervals.

    Backtesting and Strategy Validation
        Objective: Validate trade strategies with predicted price movements using historical simulations.

Short-Term and Long-Term Goals

Short-Term (0-3 Months)

    Finalize 15-minute data generation and incorporate for model training.
    Implement out-of-sequence testing.
    Refine feature engineering and interval-specific model weighting.

Long-Term (3-12 Months)

    Prepare for real-time trade execution with live prediction and trade execution.
    Build adaptive weighting based on real-time market conditions.
    Integrate macroeconomic and sentiment data for enhanced model predictions.

This roadmap reflects current objectives and sets the foundation for expanding data-driven and predictive capabilities in the SPY trading model.
