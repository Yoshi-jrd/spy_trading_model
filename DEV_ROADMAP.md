Introductory Chat for Predictive Modeling Project

Hello! I’m initiating a detailed session focused on refining our SPY options trading model. The goal is to achieve high-accuracy predictions within defined tolerance levels, specifically:

    24-48 hours: ±$2 range
    72-96 hours: ±$3 range
    168 hours: ±$5 range

Project Overview and Model Goals

We are developing a Python-based SPY options trading model that leverages machine learning techniques, specifically LSTM, RandomForest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting, stacked within a Ridge meta-model framework. The core objective is to enhance short-term predictive accuracy for SPY price action, supporting options strategies such as credit spreads, condors, and straddles.

Priority Focus:

    Key Technical Indicators: Prioritize essential indicators—MACD Histogram, RSI, Bollinger Bands, SMA/EMA.
    Rolling Features: Apply rolling averages and volatility measures for 1-hour and 1-day intervals to minimize noise and improve interval-specific accuracy.
    Interval-Specific Dynamic Weighting: Implement L1/L2 regularization for Ridge meta-models tailored to each prediction interval.

Specific Guidance for Code Writing

In this session, I am looking for structured, detailed, and tested code with an emphasis on error handling, efficiency, and readability. Key requirements include:

    Modular and Extensible: Code should be organized and modular to easily adjust model parameters, indicators, and intervals.
    Documentation: Each function or complex block should be commented with explanations of parameters, expected outputs, and any key considerations.
    Best Practices in ML: Apply best practices in machine learning, including cross-validation, regularization, and efficient handling of rolling data features.

Your assistance will include:

    Implementing Core Indicators and Rolling Features: Limit features to the essential indicators listed above with dynamic rolling windows for specified intervals.
    Dynamic Weight Optimization for Interval-Specific Models: Create Ridge meta-models for each interval (24-48h, 72-96h, 168h), incorporating L1/L2 penalties.
    Error Checking and Performance Benchmarking: Provide checks to validate input data, ensure model accuracy within our tolerance goals, and document areas for potential improvement.

I am open to any coding structure or approach that maximizes clarity, effectiveness, and potential for real-world trading applications. If additional research or specific ML techniques would enhance accuracy within our specified tolerance ranges, please integrate that insight as well.

Modularization and Code Structuring Suggestions

    Separate the Data Preparation:
        Consider moving the data preparation logic (e.g., loading, scaling, sequence preparation) to a separate file, such as data_preparation.py. This will allow more flexibility and make it easier to adjust data preparation parameters without modifying the main training code.

    Model Definitions and Training in Modules:
        We could separate the model definitions into a dedicated model_definitions.py for defining LSTM, RandomForest, GradientBoosting, and other models. Additionally, a train_models.py file could handle model training logic, like stacking and meta-model training, allowing for easy experimentation with model parameters or even adding new models.

    Configuration and Parameters File:
        A configuration file (e.g., config.json) could store parameters such as sequence length, model hyperparameters, logging level, and paths. This keeps the code cleaner and makes it easy to adjust settings without altering the code directly.

    Enhance the Logging and Error Handling:
        Logging is already in place, but adding more debug-level logs can provide better insights into each model’s performance during training. Exception handling for common data issues (e.g., NaN values) can also be helpful.

    Evaluation and Results Aggregation:
        Consider a metrics.py module to handle evaluation metrics, including MAE, RMSE, and others, in one place. This will streamline the results aggregation process and allow for standardized output across multiple files.

    Dynamic Weight Optimization:
        The optimize_weights function from dynamic_weight_optimizer can be further modularized by experimenting with weight settings for each interval and model type. This will be beneficial if we plan to add more ensemble members or change the interval-specific weights dynamically.
